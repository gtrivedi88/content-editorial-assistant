- **Root Cause**: Original implementation used `btoa(JSON.stringify(error))` which fails on Unicode in browsers
- **Fix**: Implemented `safeBase64Encode()` and `safeBase64Decode()` functions with UTF-8 encoding via `encodeURIComponent()`
- **Testing Gap**: Initial tests used ASCII-only mock data, missing real-world Unicode scenarios

- **Context**: Error occurred in `initializeTooltips()` function calling `new bootstrap.Tooltip()` without checking if Bootstrap exists
- **Fix**: Updated `core.js` with defensive Bootstrap checks and PatternFly fallback tooltip implementation
- **Changes**: 
  - Modified confidence badges to use `title` attributes instead of `data-bs-toggle="tooltip"`
  - Added PatternFly-style tooltip fallback in `initializeTooltips()` function
  - Removed Bootstrap-specific initialization from error display components
- **Testing Gap**: Assumed Bootstrap availability without checking application's actual UI framework

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Continuous Testing Strategy

**Test Automation:**
- All tests must pass before proceeding to next step
- Automated test execution on every code change
- Test coverage must be maintained above 85%
- Performance regression testing on every major change

**Test Categories:**
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for system responsiveness
- Security tests for data protection
- Accessibility tests for inclusive design

**Test Data Management:**
- Consistent test data sets across all test phases
- Test data version control and management
- Test data privacy and security compliance
- Test data refresh and maintenance procedures

### Success Criteria Per Phase

**Phase Completion Requirements:**
- All unit tests passing with 90%+ coverage
- All integration tests passing
- Performance benchmarks within acceptable limits
- Security scans passing without critical issues
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Code review approval from team leads

**Rollback Criteria:**
- Any critical test failure requiring immediate rollback
- Performance degradation beyond acceptable thresholds
- Security vulnerabilities discovered during testing
- User experience degradation beyond acceptable limits

This test-driven implementation approach ensures that each component is thoroughly validated before proceeding, reducing the risk of compounding errors and ensuring system reliability throughout the development process.
