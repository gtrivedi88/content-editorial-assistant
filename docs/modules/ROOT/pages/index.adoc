== Welcome to Content Editorial Assistant

The Content Editorial Assistant (CEA) is a comprehensive AI-powered technical writing assistant that combines sophisticated style analysis, readability scoring, and iterative AI rewriting. Designed for technical writers targeting 9th-11th grade readability standards, CEA transforms your documentation with real-time analysis and intelligent improvement suggestions.

=== Key Features

* **AI-Powered Iterative Rewriting**: Two-pass improvement system with local Ollama integration for privacy-first AI enhancement
* **Comprehensive Style Analysis**: 45+ IBM Style Guide-based rules covering grammar, punctuation, structure, and formatting
* **Multi-format Document Support**: Process PDF, DOCX, Markdown, AsciiDoc, DITA, and plain text files
* **Advanced Ambiguity Detection**: Specialized detectors for fabrication risks, missing actors, unclear references, and unsupported claims
* **Real-time Progress Tracking**: WebSocket-based communication showing actual AI work in progress
* **Readability Optimization**: Multiple readability metrics (Flesch, Gunning Fog, SMOG, Coleman-Liau, ARI) targeting 9th-11th grade levels
* **Structural Document Parsing**: Format-aware processing that preserves document structure and context
* **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design for easy addition of new rules, detectors, and AI models

=== Quick Start

1. **Prerequisites**
+
[source,bash]
----
# Python 3.12+ (CRITICAL REQUIREMENT)
python3.12 --version  # Should show Python 3.12.x
----

2. **Setup Virtual Environment**
+
[source,bash]
----
# Create and activate virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
----

3. **Install Dependencies**
+
[source,bash]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
----

4. **Run the Application**
+
[source,bash]
----
python main.py
----

5. **Access the Interface**
+
Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`
+
The application will auto-setup everything on first run:
+
* SpaCy language models
* NLTK data downloads
* Directory creation
* Dependency verification

=== Optional AI Enhancement

For the best AI rewriting experience, install Ollama with the recommended model:

[source,bash]
----
# Install Ollama (see platform-specific instructions)
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  # Linux
# OR download from https://ollama.com for Windows/macOS

# Pull recommended model
ollama pull llama3:8b  # Recommended for superior writing quality
----

**Why llama3:8b?**

* Superior writing quality and reasoning capabilities
* Excellent for complex technical writing improvements
* Better understanding of context and nuance
* Optimal performance with our two-pass iterative process

=== Advanced Features

==== AI Rewriting Process

1. **Pass 1**: AI analyzes your text and addresses specific style issues
2. **Pass 2**: AI reviews its own work and refines for maximum clarity
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Know exactly how much improvement was achieved

==== Document Format Support

* **AsciiDoc**: Full structural parsing with Ruby Asciidoctor integration
* **Markdown**: CommonMark-compatible with block-level analysis
* **PDF/DOCX**: Text extraction with format preservation
* **Plain Text**: Direct analysis with context awareness

==== Analysis Modes

* **SPACY_RULES**: Full NLP analysis with modular rules (optimal)
* **RULES_FALLBACK**: Rule-based analysis with fallbacks (good)
