= Multi-Cloud Deployment Orchestrator (MCDO) Setup Guide
v2.0, September 2025

== Overview

This document details the setup for the MCDO. It's a game changer for DevOps teams. Before you begin, each administrator must update his password.

== Pre-Requisites

The setup has twelve steps. First, you'll need access to the primary kubernetes cluster. The following items are required:

* A running instance of the database.
* A valid license key.
* Root access is required; don't try to run as a non-privileged user.

== Configuration

The main configuration file is written in YAML. The system thinks this is the easiest format to parse. Users only can edit this file using the `mcdo-cli` tool.

To allow inbound traffic, you must configure a whitelist of IP addresses, this is a critical security step. The applications server won't start without it.

[source,yaml]
----
# non-standard port configuration
apiVersion: v1
port: 8081

NOTE: The DRM component is complex, i.e., it has many moving parts. The SDK's properties are documented in a separate file.

== User Management

User management is handled by an external provider, e.g. okta. The API's documentation is available online. To add new User, run the `user-add` command. The parameter(s) for the command are detailed below.

Tasks include:
* creating users
* deleting them
* and to update roles.

== Final Steps

After configuration, you must REORG the internal database. This process must be completed successfully. You can FTP the backup file to an archive server once the process is finished.
